- 👋 Hi, I’m Ashna Gibbons
- 👀 I’m interested in operating systems, machine learning (specifically OCR software), and computer history!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and Django
- 💞️ Right now, I’m looking to collaborate on automation and productivity projects, especially if they're useful for students
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her

I am a college student studying Computer Information Systems, and I have experience mainly with Python and Java, but I also know HTML and CSS. I am a Girls Who Code member, and I love 
collaborating on projects with my colleagues there as well as pursuing my own projects in my free time. My dream job would be either a full stack developer or a system administrator!
