- 👋 Hi, I’m Ashna!
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- 👀 I’m interested in all things data: data science and analysis, database management, data security and privacy, visualization, and of course machine learning!
- 🌱 Always looking to explore new packages, languages, and libraries

On the hunt for an entry level position using data to improve people's lives and strengthen businesses however they see fit! Whether through analytical reports and insights,
database structuring, cleaning, and management, creating and implementing porductivity tools tailored to you, I believe there's a data-driven solution out there. I work mainly with Python and Java, but I also have experience with Tableau, RStudio, SPSS, and building webpages in HTML and CSS.


CUNY Honors senior double majoring in CompSci and Computer Information Systems. Former Girls Who Code member, and I love collaborating on projects with my colleagues there as well as pursuing my own projects in my free time.
